    "#Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables, such as the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you can use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "r = n(∑xy) − (∑x) (∑y) /(squareroot[n∑x** - (∑x) ** ][n∑y ** -(∑y) ** ]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "n is the number of data points (students in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "∑xy is the sum of the products of each student's study time and exam score.\n",
    "\n",
    "∑x is the sum of all the study times.\n",
    "\n",
    "∑y is the sum of all the exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "∑x**  is the sum of the squares of the study times.\n",
    "\n",
    "∑y** is the sum of the squares of the exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can interpret the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If r is close to 1: This indicates a strong positive linear relationship between study time and exam scores. In other words, as study time increases, exam scores tend to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If r is close to -1: This indicates a strong negative linear relationship between study time and exam scores. In other words, as study time increases, exam scores tend to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If r is close to 0: This suggests a weak or no linear relationship between study time and exam scores. There may be little to no correlation between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The sign of r (positive or negative) indicates the direction of the relationship. A positive sign means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase, and a negative sign means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The magnitude of r (how close it is to 1 or -1) indicates the strength of the relationship. The closer r is to 1 or -1, the stronger the linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after calculating r for your specific data, you can interpret the correlation coefficient to understand the nature and strength of the relationship between study time and exam scores among the students in your study.\n",
    "\n"
